Dive in and discover what Plus UI and its community can do for you!

### Github

Plus UI uses GitHub issues to track both bugs and feature requests. If you believe you have discovered a bug, or have an idea for a new feature, please first ensure that it has not already been reported or addressed via [<mark>reported or fixed</mark>](https://github.com/). You can search through existing issues and pull requests to determine if someone has reported an issue similar to yours.

[<mark>Open an issue on Plus UI</mark>](https://github.com/) <mark>‚ÜóÔ∏è</mark>

<Aside type="tip">

* When creating a title, please start with '\[ComponentName]' if applicable, followed by a concise description that helps others find similar issues. For example: \
  "\[Input Component] ask for support "
* To avoid spamming maintainers, please use GitHub reactions instead of commenting.
