# Shadows & Effects

## Shadows & Effects

Shadows and effects in design refer to visual techniques used to enhance the aesthetic appeal and functionality of elements within an interface.&#x20;

Shadows create a sense of depth and layering, giving objects a more three-dimensional appearance. Effects, on the other hand, encompass a broader range of visual modifications like blurs, glows, or texture overlays that add dynamism or emphasize certain aspects of the design. Together, shadows and effects contribute to the overall visual hierarchy and user experience of a design.
