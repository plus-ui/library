### New to Web Components? <a href="#new-to-web-components" id="new-to-web-components"></a>

**TL;DR**: Web components allow the creation of custom HTML elements, offering compatibility across various frameworks!

Frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React have popularized component-driven development, encapsulating styles and behaviors into reusable elements. This design approach streamlines development and testing. However, framework-specific components come with limitations—they're confined to their native framework, tied to its lifespan, and susceptible to breaking changes with new versions.

Web components transcend these limitations. They're universally supported by modern browsers, framework-independent, and standardized—ensuring longevity and reliability. This is the foundation upon which Plus UI is built.
