### Rate

* **Null rating** state represents a condition where no rating is explicitly assigned. In this state, the rating component may display as empty or unmarked, indicating that the user has not yet provided a rating for the associated content.&#x20;
* **Half rating** state occurs when a rating component allows for partial ratings, typically represented by a visual cue like half-filled icons. This state acknowledges that the user has assigned a rating that falls between two whole numbers.&#x20;
* **Full rating** state is the standard condition where a complete and whole number rating has been assigned by the user. Visually, it often involves filled icons.
