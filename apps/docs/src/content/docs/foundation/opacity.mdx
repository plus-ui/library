Opacity refers to the degree to which interface elements are translucent, allowing for the creation of various visual effects. This is achieved through a range of styles on a scale that adjust the transparency of these elements. Occasionally, opacity is specifically applied to the background of a component, enhancing its visual impact.

## Opacity Values

These are the percentage values for opacity tokens start from 0% to 100%.
