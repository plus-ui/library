## Import Plus UI as your library

Plus UI harnesses the power of Figma, allowing you to seamlessly publish libraries across your team for enhanced consistency and adherence to the style guide throughout your product.Any updates we release in subsequent versions of this Kit will be automatically reflected in the library assets of your file. This eliminates the need for manual tracking through version histories, ensuring you stay informed about changes effortlessly. Here is the comprehensive process for publishing this kit as a library within your design file.
