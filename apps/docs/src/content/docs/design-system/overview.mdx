Plus UI is a comprehensive Design System and UI Library built to create a seamless workflow between designers and developers. Our system is built on a foundation of design tokens that are shared between our Figma library and our web components.

The components within Plus UI are initially envisioned and crafted in Figma, utilizing cutting-edge features such as variants, auto-layout, grids, responsive layouts, and more.

## Plus UI Design System on Figma

Plus UI Design System is organized in a single figma folder which includes foundations and components. Each page includes design guidance and tools to help you to use and customise it.

## For Designers: Figma Setup

Our Figma library contains all the foundational styles, components, and design tokens needed to design your application.

### Step 1: Get the Library
First, get a copy of the Plus UI Design System from the Figma Community.

<a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1310670219738074447/plus-ui-design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  **Get Plus UI Design System on Figma Community →**
</a>

### Step 2: Publish as a Team Library
To use the system across your team, open the file and publish it as a library. You can do this from the "Assets" panel by clicking the library icon and choosing "Publish".

### Step 3: Enable in Your Project
Once published, open your project file, go to the "Assets" panel, click the library icon, and toggle on the "Plus UI" library. All components and styles will now be available in your project.

## For Developers: Connecting Design to Code

The same design tokens used in Figma are available in code as **CSS Custom Properties (variables)**. This ensures that what you see in the design mockups is what you get in the browser.

### The Token Bridge

- **Colors:** A color style named `primary.500` in Figma corresponds to a CSS variable like `--plus-color-primary-500`.
- **Spacing:** A spacing token of `16px` in Figma is available as `--plus-spacing-4` (`1rem`) in CSS.
- **Typography:** Font styles like "Heading/XL" in Figma map to Tailwind utility classes like `.text-xl` and `.font-bold`, which use our typography tokens.

### How It Works
Our system uses **semantic tokens** to apply these foundational values. For example, a `plus-button` with a `status="primary"` uses the `--plus-color-background-primary-default` variable. This variable, in turn, points to a brand color like `--plus-color-primary-700`.

This two-layer system allows for flexibility. You can:
1.  **Change the brand palette** (e.g., make all primary colors blue instead of indigo) for a global theme change.
2.  **Change a semantic token** (e.g., make primary buttons use a lighter shade) for a more specific change.

For a deep dive into the available tokens and how to customize them, see the **[Theming Overview](/theming/overview/)**.

This unified system ensures that designers and developers are speaking the same language, leading to faster development cycles and a more consistent end product.

## Styles & Variables

Plus UI's styles and variables enhance collaboration between designers and developers, mitigating inconsistency risks. They illuminate principles and patterns for addressing specific issues, serving as the cornerstone of our unified, centralized system.&#x20;
