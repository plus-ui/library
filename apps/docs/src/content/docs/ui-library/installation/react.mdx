## React Installation

1. Install Plus UI and the associated React packages by entering the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm install @plusui/core @plusui/react
```

2. Import the Plus UI style file anywhere in the project (for example, in the index.css file):

```jsx
import "@plusui/core/dist/style.css";
```

3. Add Plus UI Component to React Component. You can import and use Plus UI components in your React component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PlusButton } from '@plusui/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <PlusButton status="primary">Primary Button</PlusButton>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<Aside>
This component may require the addition of 'use client' declaration at the beginning when running under Next.js or similar server-client frameworks. \
