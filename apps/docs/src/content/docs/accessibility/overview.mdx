At Plus UI, we are committed to making the web accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technology they use. We believe in creating inclusive and intuitive user experiences, and accessibility is a core principle of our design and development process.

## Our Goal: WCAG 2.1 AA

Our goal is to meet the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1** at the **AA level**. This is our benchmark for all components in the library. We achieve this through:

*   **Semantic HTML**: Using correct HTML elements for their intended purpose.
*   **ARIA Attributes**: Providing appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, states, and properties to ensure compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring that all interactive components are fully operable with a keyboard. Users can navigate, interact with, and activate all components without needing a mouse.
*   **Color Contrast**: Maintaining sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements to be readable by users with low vision.

## Component-Level Accessibility

Each component documentation page includes a dedicated "Accessibility" section that outlines best practices and specific implementation details. This includes information on expected keyboard interactions, ARIA roles, and any required labels or properties you need to provide.

## Ongoing Improvement

Accessibility is an ongoing effort, not a one-time checklist. We regularly audit our components and documentation to identify and fix accessibility issues.

If you encounter an accessibility bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please do not hesitate to [**open an issue on GitHub**](https://github.com/plus-ui/library/issues/new/choose). Your feedback is invaluable in helping us create a more accessible library for everyone.
